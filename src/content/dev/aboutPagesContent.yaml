      paragraph: "NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to build the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository of spontaneously-arising canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available to the research community. The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). Bioinformatic analysis of the ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s $$[Cloud Resources](target:_self url:/#/crdc type:0)$$."
    - 
      paragraph: "Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is focused on software engineering and data science. The Applied and Developmental Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee and providing one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering Committee (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice to DCTD on the ICDC."

      paragraph: "The ICDC (Integrated Canine Data Commons) is community driven and built with input and collaboration from many groups to foster a diversity of ideas and to ensure needs are identified across the broad Research Community . To achieve this collaboration, the ICDC Steering Committee was formed to advise the NCI and FNLCR on the ICDC. The Steering Committee is composed of 11 members from the non-NIH research community, 7 from NCI, 1 from NHGRI and 1 from NCATS. There is also 1 observer from the NCI and 4 ex-officio members who are FNLCR staff. The chairperson is from the non-NIH research community."
    - 
      paragraph: "The Steering Committee has two sub-committees; Data Governance Advisory Board (DGAB) and the Best Practices Sub-Committee (BPSC)."
    - 
      paragraph: "The DGAB consists of 4 external members (all from ICDC Steering Committee), 2 NIH members (1 of whom is from CBIIT) and is supported by FNLCR staff. When researchers request their data ($${submission guide [PDF]}$$) to be added to the ICDC to be shared with the community, the role of the DGAB is to advise the NCI on the suitability of request. The NCI makes the final decision on the request. The DGAB is chaired by a non-NIH member of ICDC Steering Committee. The DGAB meets at least quarterly to review and prioritize all open and complete requests."
    - 
      paragraph: "The BPSC consists of 7 external members (all from ICDC Steering Committee), 3 NCI staff, 1 NHGRI staff and is supported by FNLCR staff. The overall goal of the BPSC is to streamline and standardize data collection and management for canine studies. The BPSC examines past and planned studies and recommends prospective standards for data collection and management in four main areas; imaging, clinical/pathology, immunology and genomic/sequencing data."

      paragraph: "$$[The Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/)$$ is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology ($$[CBIIT](https://datascience.cancer.gov/)$$). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute, or ability to easily scale resources, of the cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠."

    - 
      paragraph: "These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces."

      paragraph: "All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve the user experience and add new tools for researchers."

The user will download the Manifest and then upload the Manifest into SBG where the files will be available for analysis. The user will need a SBG account. The Manifest file is a text file consisting of CRDC Identifiers and, on uploading to SBG, the user will be able to access the relevant data files and see some basic case information."

The review in turn leads to a submission plan between ICDC and the submitter."
    - 
      paragraph: "In developing the submission plan, a primary consideration is that consumers of the data will not be as familiar with the data as the project owners. For example, submitters may find “lymphoma” implicit as a diagnosis in a given data set and thus not have use for such a field. However, this field would need to be explicit for the research community as a whole."
    - 
      paragraph: "General guidelines have been established to leverage available community standards where possible for both field name and acceptable values. Common data quality issues are: inconsistent spelling (haemotology versus hematology), inconsistent formatting (“Male” versus “male”), concatenated values which should be separate (“neutered male” should be values in two separate fields), gaps in data (Null data versus empty data versus data not collected) and format (Excel or other database compatible formats versus PDF). The ICDC data team will work with the submitter to identify and resolve these issues."
