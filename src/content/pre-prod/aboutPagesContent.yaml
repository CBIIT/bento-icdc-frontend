      paragraph: "NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to build the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository of spontaneously-arising canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available to the research community. The ICDC is part of the $$[Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/)$$, an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). Bioinformatic analysis of the ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s $$[Cloud Resources](target:_self url:/#/crdc type:0)$$."
    - 
      paragraph: "Within the FNLCR, the Bioinformatics and Computational Science (BACS) Directorate is focused on software engineering and data science. The Applied and Developmental Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee and providing one of the data sources for the ICDC. The ICDC Steering Committee is comprised of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff that provides guidance to DCTD on the ICDC."

      paragraph: "The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) is community-driven and built with input and collaboration from many groups to foster a diversity of ideas and to ensure needs are identified across the broad research community. To achieve this collaboration, the ICDC Steering Committee was formed to advise the NCI and FNLCR on the ICDC. The Steering Committee is composed of members from the non-NIH research community, NCI, NHGRI, and NCATS. There is also ex-officio members who are FNLCR staff. All chairpersons are from the non-NIH research community."

Accomplishing this goal will facilitate the utilization and analysis of such data by stakeholders in the cancer research community and facilitate dog-to-human translational research and advancement of knowledge in the comparative oncology space."
    # - 
    #   paragraph: "$$*Clinical/Pathology*$$: To provide a standard set of clinical and pathological information to be collected when conducting canine clinical trials. By defining these data points for the community, and including an appropriate list of values, we hope to be able to more easily compare subjects and their data across studies."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$*Genomics Working Group*$$: To provide an overview of next generation sequencing (NGS) study design, assays and analysis approaches (focusing on genomics and transcriptomics) used by diverse canine cancer research teams alongside annotation of validation studies, canine-specific tooling and parameters, identify common data elements across published analyses, establish general principles in canine cancer genomics best practices modeled on human cancer genomics best practice principles; identify gaps in canine cancer genomics best practices and propose solutions."
    # - 
    #   paragraph: "$$*Immunology*$$: To provide a standard and expandable set of immunologic measurements to contextualize the changes that occur during treatment of spontaneously arising cancer in canines. Basic measurements will be compared across studies, while specialized study measurements will be used to understand specific outcomes. We hope this will lead to a better understanding of response to immunologic treatment and potentially to providing potential lines of investigation for treatment in humans."

      paragraph: "$$#CRDC:#$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "$$[The Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/)$$ is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology ($$[CBIIT](https://datascience.cancer.gov/)$$). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage, elastic compute, and scalability of the cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$#CLOUD RESOURCES:#$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "The CRDC has three Cloud Resources ($$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud powered by Velsera ](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)$$,$$[ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud ](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$, $$[Broad Firecloud ](https://firecloud.terra.bio/)$$), each providing analysis platforms for the community to use when working with data from the CRDC ecosystem."
    - 
      paragraph: "These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by enabling the ability to bring analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or to upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces."
    - 
      paragraph: "All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve the user experience and add new tools for researchers."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$*SEVEN BRIDGES CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (CGC)*$$ is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 900 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit (SDK)."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$*INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (ISB-CGC)*$$ leverages many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and allows scientists to interactively define and compare cohorts, examine underlying molecular data for specific genes and pathways, and share insights with collaborators. For computational users, application program interfaces (APIs) and GCP resources such as BigQuery and Google Pipeline service, allow complex queries from R or Python scripts, or Dockerized workflows to run on data available in Google Cloud Storage."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$*BROAD INSTITUTE FIRECLOUD*$$ is an open, standards-based platform for performing production-scale data analysis in the cloud. Built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Firecloud empowers analysts, tool developers, and production managers to run large-scale analysis and to share results with collaborators. Users can upload their own analysis methods and data to workspaces or run the Broad’s best practice tools and pipelines."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$*FROM ICDC TO CLOUD RESOURCES:*$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "Currently the ICDC supports analysis via the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud powered by Velsera."
    - 
      paragraph: "One of the primary goals of the ICDC data portal is to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to lower the barriers for researchers to go from cohort discovery to a meaningful analysis. Researchers can find cases and build cohorts in the ICDC and then send the associated files required for analysis to the "My Files" Cart page where the list of files is compiled into a File Manifest. The File Manifest is simply a csv file consisting of rich metadata and Data Repository Service (DRS) Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs) for every file object listed. Using the new "Export to the CGC" button enables the simple and immediate transfer of a File Manifest to the CGC with only a single click. The CGC uses information in the File Manifest to fetch the file from a DRS server and storage buckets located in the cloud. Alternatively, users can download the File Manifest locally and then subsequently upload the File Manifest directly into the CGC to load files into a CGC project.

    -
      paragraph: "The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine malignancies. Researchers who have data that will contribute to this mission and who are willing to share that data via the ICDC are encouraged to make a data submission request through the $${title:Submission Request Process [PDF],link:https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-codebase/raw/master/src/main/frontend/src/content/files/ICDC_DGAB_Guidelines_v1.3.pdf}$$. Please email $$@ICDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov@$$ for specific instructions. All proposed data submissions are reviewed by the Data Governance Advisory Board $$[(DGAB)](target:_self url:/#/DGAB)$$ to assess their scientific value and suitability for inclusion. Once any given study has been fully on-boarded, all data submitted will become publicly available."
    -  
      paragraph: "To initiate a Data Submission Request, please use this $${title:Template,link:https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-codebase/raw/master/src/main/frontend/src/content/files/ICDC_Data_Submission_Request_Template.docx}$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "Importantly, studies need not be complete to start a submission request. Indeed, working with the ICDC development team before defining your data collection processes can be beneficial, since we can advise on best practices and existing precedent to make the data submission process more efficient and thereby speed up the on-boarding of each new study. For studies that have already been completed, the ICDC Data Team will nonetheless provide appropriate guidance on data alignment."
    - 
      paragraph: "$$#THE DATA MODEL NAVIGATOR AND DATA PREPARATION:#$$"
    -
      paragraph: "In support of data submissions, the ICDC application now includes a sophisticated and intuitive $$[Data Model Navigator](target:_self url:/#/icdc-data-model)$$ which provides end users in general, and data submitters in particular, with access to a wealth of information regarding the graph-based data model upon which the ICDC is based."
    -
      paragraph: "The Data Model Navigator’s Graph View provides an interactive, graphical rendering of the data model, which can be filtered in order to identify the nodes (equivalent to tables in traditional relational databases) and therefore properties (equivalent to fields) of most relevance to any given study. The associated Table View function displays detailed tabular views of each node which fully-define the properties within them, inclusive of the applicable controlled vocabularies of acceptable terms, and identify which properties are required versus preferred or optional."
    -  
      paragraph: "Comprehensive documentation of the data model’s nodes and property requirements can be downloaded in PDF format, alongside node-specific data loading templates into which data submitters can insert the relevant data values and thereby create loading-ready data files. In addition, machine-readable versions of any given controlled vocabulary of interest can be downloaded, in support of data submitters validating their templated data prior to its submission. All potential data submitters are therefore strongly encouraged to use the Data Model Navigator to familiarize themselves with the ICDC data model prior to initiating the data submission process."
    -
      paragraph: "$$#THE DATA ON-BOARDING PROCESS:#$$"
    -
      paragraph: "Once a study submission has been reviewed by the DGAB and accepted for inclusion, the ICDC Data Team will work directly with the data submitter(s) to review the data in terms of its structure, the data values in use versus ICDC’s preferred terminology, and overall data quality and consistency. This collaborative review process will, in turn, lead to the development of a data submission plan and a timeline over which the study on-boarding work is anticipated to be conducted."
    -
      paragraph: "In developing the submission plan, a primary consideration is that consumers of the data will not be as familiar with the data as the data owners. For example, a diagnosis of “Lymphoma” may be implicit for a study that examines only that type of malignancy, but a value for diagnosis would still need to be explicitly stated for the benefit of the research community as a whole. In line with this policy, the ICDC also favors the use of relatively broad terminology in some places (e.g. diagnosis and primary disease site), versus very specific terminology (e.g. sample pathology and sample site)."
    -
      paragraph: "As more and more studies have been incorporated into the ICDC, and in the interests of data consistency, clear expectations have now been established around the level of case and sample annotations and the appropriate sets of acceptable values. Common data quality issues include inconsistent terminology (e.g. Transitional Cell Carcinoma vs. Urothelial Bladder Cancer), inconsistent spelling (e.g. Tumour vs. Tumor), inconsistent formatting (e.g. Male vs. male), concatenated values which should be separated (e.g. “Spayed female”, which should instead be provided as values for two separate properties of Sex and Neutered Status), and gaps in data (e.g. missing data vs. situations where data values should be quoted as “Not Applicable” vs. data values deliberately not collected, i.e. “Not Determined”). The ICDC Data Team will work with the submitter to identify and resolve any such issues, and in situations where the existing controlled vocabularies need to be extended by the addition of new terms, the data model will be updated accordingly. All data is fully validated against the requirements specified by the data model during data loading to ensure correct data alignment and preserve data consistency. "
