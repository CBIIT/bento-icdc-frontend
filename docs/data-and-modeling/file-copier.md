# File Copier
This is the user documentation for the File Copier module contained in the ICDC-Dataloader utility.

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f4d5afb8403642dbab917cb4aa4ef47d)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/CBIIT/icdc-dataloader?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=CBIIT/icdc-dataloader&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Introduction
The File Copier copies files from a source URL to a designated AWS S3 Bucket. It has 3 modes of operation:

* **Master mode** - The File Copier will read all of the file information from the pre-manifest, push jobs onto the job queue, and then listen to the results queue for the loading results.
* **Slave mode** - The File Copier will grab jobs from the job queue, perform the copy job, and then push the job result to the result queue.
* **Solo mode** - The File Copier will read all of the file information from the pre-manifest and then copy all of the files to the destination S3 bucket.

The File Copier can be found in this Github Repository: [ICDC-Dataloader](https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-dataloader)

## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.6 or newer
* An initialized destination AWS S3 bucket
* AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Initialized Job and Result SQS FIFO Queues (````master```` and ````slave```` modes only)
* An adapter to process information read from pre-manifest

## Dependencies
Run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies. Or run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` if you are using virtualenv. The dependencies included in ````requirements.txt```` are listed below:

*   pyyaml
*   neo4j - version 1.7.6
*   boto3
*   requests

## Inputs
*   The location of the files to be copied
*   The name of the destination S3 bucket
*   A File Copier config file
*   The module name and class name of the adapter for the data being transferred
*   A pre-manifest file (in TSV format)
*   The names of the job and result SQS FIFO queues (````master```` and ````slave```` modes only)

## Outputs
The File Copier module will produce following outputs

*    Copies files into the specified S3 bucket
*    Generates two manifest files in the same place as pre-manifest file, one for DCF/IndexD, the other for Neo4j database.
*    Log messages to console as well as a log file inside ````tmp/```` folder.

## Configuration file
All the inputs of File Copier can be set in a YAML format configuration file by using the fields defined below. 

An example configuration file can be found in ````config/file-copier-config.example.yml````

*  ````domain````: The domain name of the project.
*  ````adapter_module````: The module name of the adapter that will be used by the File Copier during operation.
*  ````adapter_class````: The class name of the adapter that will be used by the File Copier during operation.
*  ````adapter_params````: An object which contains parameters for the adapter's constructor. Only available in configuration file, not as CLI arguments.
*  ````bucket````: The files in the source S3 Bucket will be copied into this destination S3 Bucket.
*  ````prefix````: Prefix for files being copied into the destination bucket.
*  ````first````: The first line to load. Lines are indexed starting with 1 and header lines are not counted.
*  ````count````: The number of files to be copy, a value of ````-1```` will copy all files.
*  ````retry````: The number of times that the File Copier will retry the copy operation.
*  ````mode````: The mode that the File Copier will run, the only valid inputs are ````master````, ````slave````, and ````solo````.
*  ````job_queue````: The File Copier will send jobs to the job SQS queue with the name specified by this input.
*  ````result_queue````: The results of the File Copier jobs will be sent to the result SQS queue with the name specified by this input.
*  ````pre_manifest````: The TSV file containing the details of the files to be copied.
*  ````overwrite````: Overwrites files even if they already exist in the destination and are the same size.
*  ````dryrun````: Runs checks on original files but does not perform the copy operation.
*  ````verify_md5````: Verify that the size and MD5 hash of the original file and the generated copy are the same.
